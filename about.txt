Background

I've worked with Data since before my graduation from Mathematics of Universitas Indonesia. It has been 9 years I am learning statistics and programming to obtain information from Data. I've worked with different type of data from simple tabular data, XML, images and text. I understand developing and evaluating machine learning, automating reports, dashboarding, and some of ETL stack. 

On the other hand, I'm joining and developing Data Science Indonesia Community since 2015. I voluntarily join the community to building up Data awareness ecosystem in Indonesia. I start with mentoring, building up the knowledge and sharing session. 

In my journey, I have gain knowledges of tools for such analysis like excel, jupyter, docker, pandas and tensorflow. In dashboarding I usually operate Tableau or Google data studio. I can do programming, mostly in Python and fluently in query (Bigquery, SQL or flink query).
